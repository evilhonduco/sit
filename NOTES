API
  Simple C 
  Pull and Push based reads
  Single-threaded string chunk stream writes
  Pluggable SAXish document parser
  
Nestedness
  docs have names.. __field:root, __field:root.inner, etc
  does that mean INSIDE is an operator?
  does that mean that there should be push/pop stack commands?
    what about fragmented/interleaved docs?  
      stop/resume doc?
  
Ruby
  Tests are in Ruby
  A network api is provided in eventmachine (want to port to mbuf/c)
  
JSON Interface
 Queries:
  [{"key": "\"hello world\" goodbye"}, ...]

Query
  ORs of (AND | NEAR(N))s of (NOT? key:value)
  [title:foo NEAR(N) title:bar] means title:foo AND title:bar AND pos(bar) > pos(foo) AND pos(bar) <= pos(foo) + N
  No further nesting allowed--use distributivity and De Morgan's law
  
Results
  Pull results are provided individually, with a pointer to the state necessary to generate the next result
  Push results are pushed at a callback handler
  
Protocol
  Simple, line-oriented, tcp/stream protocol, pipelined.
  command "args"\n
  {} // json
  all responses are json
  commands are stateful/modal (e.g. you can add command 1x, then stream documents)
  
Parser
  Documents have finite size, so the parser allocates O(1) space ahead of time.
  Rough C call stack:

    - engine_consume
      - engine_append
      - parser->consume
        - engine_field_found
        - engine_term_found
        - engine_document_found
          - engine_percolate
          - engine_index
  
  Ruby version (with mixed C)

		- engine = Engine.new(parser) # establishes bidi reference
			  													# (reusing parsers is Exception)
		- engine.consume(str)
			- engine_consume
				- engine_append
				- parser#consume(str) # no super, just full custom code
					- parser#field_found()
						- engine#field_found()
							- engine_field_found
					- parser#term_found()
						- engine#term_found()
							- engine_term_found
					- parser#document_found()
						- engine#document_found()
							- engine_document_found
				          - engine_percolate
				          - engine_index
		

Storage
  Three regions
    Document stream persisted
    Term index
    Posting lists
  Stream, plists are ring buffer of subregions
  Term index is a LRWritten Hash table.

Posting lists
  
Percolation tricks
  Document terms are added to a hash table
  Queries are structured as a tree of hash tables.  This is consistent because clauses are sortable--[a AND b] and [b AND a] will both evaluate to the same path through the tree.
  DFS matches out of the tree.
